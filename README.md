### **Project: Automated Vulnerability Management System**

This project will guide you through implementing an Automated Vulnerability Management System, focusing on continuous detection, integration with a SIEM system for central visibility, automated ticketing for efficient issue tracking, and reporting on security metrics. This approach ensures proactive identification, management, and resolution of vulnerabilities, aligning with best practices in enterprise security.

---

## **Objective**
The main objectives of this project are to:
1. **Continuously scan for vulnerabilities** using a vulnerability scanner.
2. **Integrate results into a SIEM system** for analysis, visibility, and alerting.
3. **Automate ticket creation** to ensure each vulnerability is logged and assigned for resolution.
4. **Generate security metrics reports** for continuous improvement and security governance.

## **Prerequisites**
- Access to a Linux server or virtual machine with `sudo` privileges.
- Internet connection to download open-source tools like OpenVAS or Nessus.
- Access to your SIEM platform (Splunk, ELK, or an alternative).
- Basic understanding of Linux, scripting, and vulnerability management.

---

### **Step 1: Set up an Open-Source Vulnerability Scanner (e.g., OpenVAS or Nessus)**

For this project, we'll use **OpenVAS** due to its open-source nature and comprehensive vulnerability detection capabilities.

#### **1.1 Install OpenVAS (on Ubuntu)**
   - Update system packages:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
     ```
   - Add the OpenVAS repository:
     ```bash
     sudo add-apt-repository ppa:mrazavi/openvas
     sudo apt update
     ```
   - Install OpenVAS:
     ```bash
     sudo apt install openvas -y
     ```
   - Initialize OpenVAS (this will set up databases and services):
     ```bash
     sudo gvm-setup
     ```
   - After installation, start the OpenVAS services:
     ```bash
     sudo gvm-start
     ```

#### **1.2 Access OpenVAS Web Interface**
   - Retrieve the admin password:
     ```bash
     sudo cat /var/lib/gvm/private/CA/gvmd.log | grep "Password"
     ```
   - Access the OpenVAS web interface by navigating to `https://localhost:9392` or replace `localhost` with your server IP.

#### **1.3 Configure and Start Scanning**
   - Log into the OpenVAS interface with the admin credentials.
   - Configure scanning policies and initiate a vulnerability scan on your target network.

---

### **Step 2: Integrate Scan Results into a SIEM System (e.g., Splunk or ELK Stack)**

Integrating scan results into a SIEM provides a centralized view of vulnerabilities alongside other security data, enhancing visibility and incident response capabilities.

#### **2.1 Configure OpenVAS to Export Scan Results**
   - From the OpenVAS interface, configure a regular export of scan results in a structured format like JSON, CSV, or XML.
   - Schedule scans to run periodically, for example, weekly or monthly, depending on your security requirements.

#### **2.2 Set Up Data Forwarding to the SIEM**
   - **For Splunk**:
     1. Install the Splunk Universal Forwarder on the OpenVAS server:
        ```bash
        wget -O splunkforwarder.deb 'https://download.splunk.com/products/universalforwarder/releases/X.X.X/linux/splunkforwarder-X.X.X-Linux-x86_64.deb'
        sudo dpkg -i splunkforwarder.deb
        ```
     2. Configure the forwarder to send OpenVAS logs to your Splunk instance.

   - **For ELK Stack**:
     - Install Filebeat on the OpenVAS server to forward log data:
       ```bash
       sudo apt install filebeat
       ```
     - Configure Filebeat to point to your Elasticsearch server:
       ```yaml
       # Inside /etc/filebeat/filebeat.yml
       output.elasticsearch:
         hosts: ["your-elk-server:9200"]
       ```
     - Set up a Filebeat input to read OpenVAS reports and scan logs.

#### **2.3 Visualize Vulnerabilities in SIEM Dashboard**
   - Create dashboards in Splunk or Kibana to visualize vulnerability data, including counts of critical vulnerabilities, trends over time, and affected systems.

### **Step 3: Automate Ticket Creation for Detected Vulnerabilities**

Ticketing ensures that each vulnerability is tracked, prioritized, and resolved.

#### **3.1 Select a Ticketing System**
   - Use Jira, ServiceNow, or an internal system with an API to create tickets automatically.

#### **3.2 Write a Script for Automated Ticket Creation**
   - Here’s a Python script to automate ticket creation in Jira based on the scan output. This script parses OpenVAS JSON reports for critical vulnerabilities and opens tickets for each.

   ```python
   import requests
   import json

   # Jira API credentials and configuration
   JIRA_URL = 'https://yourcompany.atlassian.net'
   API_ENDPOINT = f'{JIRA_URL}/rest/api/2/issue'
   USER = 'your-email@example.com'
   TOKEN = 'your-api-token'

   # Load OpenVAS scan report (example JSON file path)
   with open('/path/to/openvas_report.json') as f:
       report_data = json.load(f)

   for vulnerability in report_data['vulnerabilities']:
       if vulnerability['severity'] == 'Critical':
           payload = {
               "fields": {
                   "project": {"key": "SEC"},
                   "summary": f"Critical vulnerability: {vulnerability['title']}",
                   "description": vulnerability['description'],
                   "issuetype": {"name": "Bug"},
                   "priority": {"name": "Critical"}
               }
           }
           response = requests.post(API_ENDPOINT, auth=(USER, TOKEN), json=payload)
           if response.status_code == 201:
               print("Ticket created successfully.")
           else:
               print("Failed to create ticket:", response.text)
   ```

#### **3.3 Automate the Script Execution**
   - Schedule the script to run daily using `cron`:
     ```bash
     crontab -e
     ```
   - Add this line to run the script daily at midnight:
     ```bash
     0 0 * * * /usr/bin/python3 /path/to/jira_ticket_script.py
     ```

### **Step 4: Create Automated Reports on Security Metrics**

Automated reports provide an overview of security status and help track remediation progress.

#### **4.1 Define Reporting Metrics**
   - Determine the metrics to include, such as:
     - Total vulnerabilities detected (by severity).
     - Trends over time (e.g., weekly reduction in critical vulnerabilities).
     - Average time to resolve vulnerabilities.
     - Percentage of remediated vs. unresolved vulnerabilities.

#### **4.2 Generate Reports from SIEM Data**
   - **Splunk**: Use the `report` functionality to generate summaries and schedule email delivery.
   - **ELK**: Create visualizations in Kibana dashboards, such as pie charts for severity levels or line charts for vulnerability trends.

#### **4.3 Automate Report Delivery**
   - Configure email delivery of these reports to key stakeholders on a weekly or monthly basis.
   - In Splunk, go to your report settings, choose **Schedule Report**, and select email delivery options.
   - In Kibana, consider using Watcher (if on the paid tier) or automating with scheduled export scripts.

#### **4.4 Store Reports for Auditing and Compliance**
   - Set up a secure directory (e.g., `/var/reports/vulnerability`) to store historical reports.
   - Schedule an automated backup to ensure they’re retained for compliance audits.

### **Summary**

This project sets up an automated vulnerability management system that scans for security issues, forwards data to a SIEM for central monitoring, creates tickets for actionable vulnerabilities, and automates reporting. By the end of this project, you’ll have a robust vulnerability management process that’s easily scalable and maintainable in a real-world production environment. With this solution, your organization can actively manage vulnerabilities, track remediation efforts, and stay ahead of potential threats.
